PV is a program like Microsoft Spy++. Unlike Microsoft Spy++, it allows you to edit some properties of controls and manage their window messages. 
You can change Text, Visibility, Enabled, Window Styles and Window Ex Styles properties of a control by using PV at runtime.
Additionally, you can ignore window messages, replace incoming messages with different messages or edit parameters of any window messages by putting breakpoints to the control’s window procedure with PV.
